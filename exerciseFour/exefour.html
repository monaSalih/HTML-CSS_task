 <hr/>
    <p style="background-color:#660000;  color:white;" >
    <B>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</B>
    <br/>
    <br/>
     <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br/>
     when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br/>
     It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <br/>
     essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br/>
     and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
